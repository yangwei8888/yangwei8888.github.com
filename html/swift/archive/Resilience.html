Resilience. It should not be taken as a plan of record.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="introduction">
<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>One of Swift&#8217;s primary design goals is to allow efficient execution of code
without sacrificing load-time abstraction of implementation.</p>
<p>Abstraction of implementation means that code correctly written against a
published interface will correctly function when the underlying implementation
changes to anything which still satisfies the original interface. There are many
potential reasons to provide this sort of abstraction. Apple&#8217;s primary interest
is in making it easy and painless for our internal and external developers to
improve the ecosystem of Apple products by creating good and secure programs and
libraries; subtle deployment problems and/or unnecessary dependencies on the
behavior of our implementations would work against these goals.</p>
<p>Almost all languages provide some amount of abstraction of implementation. For
example, functions are usually opaque data types which fully abstract away the
exact sequence of operations performed.  Similarly, adding a new field to a C
struct does not break programs which refer to a different field — those programs
may need to be recompiled, but once recompiled, they should continue to
work. (This would not necessarily be true if, say, fields were accessed by index
rather than by name.)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="components">
<h2>Components<a class="headerlink" href="#components" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Programs and libraries are not distributed as a legion of source files assembled
independently by the end user. Instead, they are packaged into larger components
which are distributed and loaded as a unit.  Each component that comprises a
program may depend on some number of other components; this graph of
dependencies can be assumed to be acyclic.</p>
<p>Because a component is distributed as a unit, ABI resilience within the
component is not required. It may still help to serve as a build- time
optimization, but Swift aims to offer substantially better build times than
C/C++ programs due to other properties of the language (the module system, the
lack of a preprocessor, the instantiation model, etc.).</p>
<p>Components may be defined as broadly as an entire operating system or as
narrowly as the build products of an individual team. The development process of
a very large product (like an operating system) may discourage a model which
requires almost the entire system to be recompiled when a low-level component is
changed, even if recompilation is relatively fast. Swift aims to reduce the need
for unnecessary abstraction penalties where possible, but to allow essentially
any model that conforms to the basic rule of acyclicity.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="abstraction-throughout-the-program-lifecycle">
<h2>Abstraction Throughout the Program Lifecycle<a class="headerlink" href="#abstraction-throughout-the-program-lifecycle" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Most languages provide different amounts of abstraction at different stages in
the lifecycle of a program. The stages are:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Compilation, when individual source files are translated into a form suitable
for later phases. The abstractions of C/C++ object layout and C++ virtual
table layout are only provided until this stage; adding a field to a struct
or a virtual method to a class potentially require all users of those
interfaces to be recompiled.</li>
<li>Bundling, when compiled source files are combined into a larger component;
this may occur in several stages, e.g. when object files are linked into a
shared library which is then bundled up into an OS distribution. Objective-C
classes in the non-fragile ABI are laid out by special processing that occurs
during bundling; this is done just as an optimization and the runtime can
force additional layout changes at execution time, but if that were not true,
the abstraction would be lost at this stage.</li>
<li>Installation, when bundled components are placed on the system where they
will be executed. This is generally a good stage in which to lose abstraction
if implementations are always installed before interfaces. This is the first
stage whose performance is visible to the end user, but unless installation
times are absurdly long, there is little harm to doing extra processing here.</li>
<li>Loading, when a component is loaded into memory in preparation for executing
it. Objective-C performs class layout at this stage; after loading completes,
no further changes to class layout are possible.  Java also performs layout
and additional validation of class files during program loading. Processing
performed in this stage delays the start-up of a program (or plugin or other
component).</li>
<li>Execution, when a piece of code actually evaluates. Objective-C guarantees
method lookup until this &#8220;stage&#8221;, meaning that it is always possible to
dynamically add methods to a class. Languages which permit code to be
dynamically reloaded must also enforce abstraction during execution, although
JIT techniques can mitigate some of this expense.  Processing performed in
this stage directly slows down the operation.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="expressivity">
<h2>Expressivity<a class="headerlink" href="#expressivity" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Certain language capabilities are affected by the choice of when to
break down the abstraction.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>If the language runtime offers functions to dynamically explore and, by
reflection, use the language structures in a component, some amount of
metadata must survive until execution time. For example, invoking a function
would require the signature and ABI information about the types it uses to be
preserved sufficiently for the invocation code to reassemble it.</li>
<li>If the language runtime offers functions to dynamically change or augment the
language structures in a component, the full abstractions associated with
those structures must be preserved until execution time. For example, if an
existing &#8220;virtual&#8221; method can be replaced at runtime, no devirtualization is
permitted at compile time and there must be some way to at least map that
method to a vtable offset in all derived classes; and if such a method can be
dynamically added, there must be some ability for method dispatch to fall back
on a dictionary.</li>
<li>The above is equally true for class extensions in components which may be
loaded or unloaded dynamically.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="performance">
<h2>Performance<a class="headerlink" href="#performance" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The performance costs of abstraction mostly take three forms:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>the direct cost of many small added indirections</li>
<li>code-size inflation due to the extra logic to implement these operations</li>
<li>diminished potential for more powerful optimizations such as inlining and code
motion</li>
</ul>
<p>As mentioned before, we can avoid these costs within components because classes
cannot be extended within components.</p>
<p>We wish to avoid these costs wherever possible by exploiting the deployment
properties of programs.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="summary-of-design">
<h2>Summary of Design<a class="headerlink" href="#summary-of-design" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Our current design in Swift is to provide opt-out load-time abstraction of
implementation for all language features. Alone, this would either incur
unacceptable cost or force widespread opting-out of abstraction. We intend to
mitigate this primarily by designing the language and its implementation to
minimize unnecessary and unintended abstraction:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Within the component that defines a language structure, all the details of its
implementation are available.</li>
<li>When language structures are not exposed outside their defining components,
their implementation is not constrained.</li>
<li>By default, language structures are not exposed outside their defining
components. This is independently desirable to reduce accidental API surface
area, but happens to also interact well with the performance design.</li>
<li>Avoiding unnecessary language guarantees and taking advantage of that
flexibility to limit load-time costs.</li>
</ul>
<p>We also intend to provide tools to detect inadvertent changes in
interfaces.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id2">
<h2>Components<a class="headerlink" href="#id2" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>(This is just a sketch and deserves its own design document.)</p>
<p>Swift will have an integrated build system. This serves several purposes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>it creates a &#8220;single source of truth&#8221; about the project that can be shared
between tools,</li>
<li>it speeds up compiles by limiting redundant computation between files, and</li>
<li>it gives the compiler information about the boundaries between components.</li>
</ul>
<p>In complex cases, the build process is going to need to be described.  Complex
cases include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>complex component hierarchies (see below)</li>
<li>the presence of non-Swift source files (to support directly: .s, .c, .o, maybe
.m, .mm, .cpp)</li>
<li>a build product other than an executable (to support directly: executable,
.dylib (.framework?), .o, maybe some binary component distribution)</li>
<li>library requirements</li>
<li>deployment requirements</li>
<li>compilation options more complicated than -On</li>
</ul>
<p>This specification file will basically function as the driver interface to Swift
and will probably need a similar host of features, e.g. QA overrides,
inheritance of settings from B&amp;I. Some sort of target-based programming may also
be required.</p>
<p>Components may be broken down into hierarchies of subcomponents. The component
graph must still be acyclic.</p>
<p>Every component has a resilience domain , a component (either itself or an
ancestor in its component hierarchy) outside of which resilience is required. By
default, this is the top-level component in its hierarchy.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="access">
<h2>Access<a class="headerlink" href="#access" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>(sketch)</p>
<p>A lot of code is not intended for use outside the component it appears in. Here
are four levels of access control, along with their proposed spellings:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>[api] accessible from other components</li>
<li>[public] accessible only from this component (may need finer grades of control
to deal with non-trivial component hierarchies, e.g.  public(somecomponent))</li>
<li>[private] accessible only from this source file</li>
<li>[local] accessible only from things lexically included in the containing
declaration (may not be useful)</li>
</ul>
<p>A language structure&#8217;s accessibility is inherited by default from its lexical
context.</p>
<p>The global context (i.e. the default accessibility) is [public], i.e.
accessible from this component but not outside it.</p>
<p>A language structure which is accessible outside the component it appears in is
said to be exported.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id3">
<h2>Resilience<a class="headerlink" href="#id3" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In general, resilience is the ability to change the implementation of a language
structure without requiring further pre-load-time processing of code that uses
that structure and whose resilience domain does not include the component
defining that structure.</p>
<p>Resilience does not permit changes to the language structure&#8217;s interface. This
is a fairly vague standard (that will be spelled out below), but in general, an
interface change is a change which would cause existing code using that
structure to not compile or to compile using different formal types.</p>
<p>Language structures may opt out of resilience with an attribute,
[fragile]. Deployment versions may be associated with the attribute, like so:
[fragile(macosx10.7, ios5)]. It is an interface change to remove an [fragile]
attribute, whether versioned or unversioned. It is an interface change to add an
unversioned [fragile] attribute. It is not an interface change to add a
versioned [fragile] attribute. There is also a [resilient] attribute, exclusive
to any form of [fragile], to explicitly describe a declaration as resilient.</p>
<p>Resilience is lexically inherited. It is not lexically constrained; a resilient
language structure may have fragile sub-structures and vice- versa. The global
context is resilient, although since it is also [public] (and not [api]),
objects are not in practice constrained by resilience.</p>
<p>We intend to provide a tool to automatically detect interface changes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="properties-of-types">
<h2>Properties of types<a class="headerlink" href="#properties-of-types" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A deployment is an abstract platform name and version.</p>
<p>A type exists on a deployment if:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>it is a builtin type, or</li>
<li>it is a function type and its argument and result types exist on the
deployment, or</li>
<li>it is a tuple type and all of its component types exist on the deployment, or</li>
<li>it is a struct, class, or enum type and it does not have an [available]
attribute with a later version for a matching platform name.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is an interface change for an exported type to gain an [available] attribute.</p>
<p>A type is empty if it has a fragile representation (defined below) and:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>it is a tuple type with no non-empty component types, or</li>
<li>it is a struct type with no non-empty fields, or</li>
<li>it is an enum type with one alternative which either carries no data or
carries data with an empty type.</li>
</ul>
<p>A type has a fragile representation if:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>it is a builtin type. The representation should be obvious from the type.</li>
<li>it is a function type. The representation is a pair of two pointers: a valid
function pointer, and a potentially null retainable pointer.  See the section
on calls for more information.</li>
<li>it is a tuple type with only fragilely-represented component types.  The
representation of a tuple uses the Swift struct layout algorithm.  This is
true even if the tuple does not have a fragile representation.</li>
<li>it is a class type (that is, a reference struct type). The representation is a
valid retainable pointer.</li>
<li>it is a fragile struct type with no resilient fields and no fields whose type
is fragilely represented. The representation uses the Swift struct layout
algorithm.</li>
</ul>
<p>A type has a universally fragile representation if there is no deployment of the
target platform for which the type exists and is not fragilely represented. It
is a theorem that all components agree on whether a type has a universal fragile
representation and, if so, what the size, unpadded size, and alignment of that
type is.</p>
<p>Swift&#8217;s struct layout algorithm takes as input a list of fields, and does the
following:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">The fields are ranked:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The universally fragile fields rank higher than the others.</li>
<li>If two fields A and B are both universally fragile,</li>
<li>If no other condition applies, fields that appear earlier in the original
sequence have higher rank.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The size of the structure is initially 0.</p>
<p>representations and A&#8217;s type is more aligned than B&#8217;s type, or otherwise if A
appears before B in the original ordering.</p>
</li>

<p>Swift provides the following types:</p>
<p>A language structure may be resilient but still define or have a type</p>
<p>In the following discussion, it will be important to distinguish between types
whose values have a known representation and those which may not.</p>
<p>Swift provides</p>
<p>For some structures, it may be important to know that the structure has never
been deployed resiliently, so in general it is considered an interface change to
change a</p>
<p>Resilience affects pretty much every language feature.</p>
<p>Execution-time abstraction does not come without cost, and we do not wish to
incur those costs where unnecessary. Many forms of execution- time abstraction
are unnecessary except as a build-time optimization, because in practice the
software is deployed in large chunks that can be compiled at the same
time. Within such a resilience unit , many execution-time abstractions can be
broken down. However, this means that the resilience of a language structure is
context-dependent: it may need to be accessed in a resilient manner from one
resilience unit, but can be accessed more efficiently from another. A structure
which is not accessible outside its resilience unit is an important exception. A
structure is said to be exported if it is accessible in some theoretical context
outside its resilience unit.</p>
<p>A structure is said to be resilient if accesses to it rely only on its</p>
<p>A structure is said to be universally non-resilient if it is non- resilient in
all contexts in which it is accessible.</p>
<p>Many APIs are willing to selectively &#8220;lock down&#8221; some of their component
structures, generally because either the form of the structure is inherent (like
a point being a pair of doubles) or important enough to performance to be worth
committing to (such as the accessors of a basic data structure). This requires
an [unchanging] annotation and is equivalent to saying that the structure is
universally non-resilient.</p>
<p>Most language structures in Swift have resilience implications. This document
will need to be updated as language structures evolve and are enhanced.</p>

<div class="section" id="type-categories">
<h2>Type categories<a class="headerlink" href="#type-categories" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>For the purposes of this document, there are five categories of type in Swift.</p>
<p><strong>Primitive types</strong>: i1, float32, etc. Nominal types defined by the
implementation.</p>
<p><strong>Functions</strong>: () -&gt; int, (NSRect, bool) -&gt; (int, int), etc.  Structural types
with</p>
<p><strong>Tuples</strong>: (NSRect, bool), (int, int), etc. Structural product types.</p>
<p><strong>Named value types</strong>: int, NSRect, etc. Nominal types created by a variety of
language structures.</p>
<p><strong>Named reference types</strong>: MyBinaryTree, NSWindow, etc. Nominal types created by
a variety of language structures.</p>
<p>Primitive types are universally non-resilient.</p>
<p>Function types are universally non-resilient (but see the section on calls).</p>
<p>Tuple types are non-resilient if and only if all their component types are
non-resilient.</p>
<p>Named types declared within a function are universally non-resilient.</p>
<p>Named types with the [unchanging] annotation are universally non-
resilient. Problem, because of the need/desire to make things depend on whether
a type is universally non-resilient. Makes it impossible to add [unchanging]
without breaking ABI. See the call section.</p>
<p>All other named types are non-resilient only in contexts that are in the same
resilient unit as their declaring file.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="storage">
<h2>Storage<a class="headerlink" href="#storage" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Primitive types always have the primitive&#8217;s size and alignment.</p>
<p>Named reference types always have the size and alignment of a single pointer.</p>
<p>Function types always have the size and alignment of two pointers, the first
being a maximally-nonresilient function pointer (see the section on calls) and
the second being a retain/released pointer.</p>
<p>If a tuple type is not universally non-resilient, its elements are stored
sequentially using C struct layout rules. Layout must be computed at
runtime. Separate storage is not really a feasible alternative.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="named-types">
<h2>Named types<a class="headerlink" href="#named-types" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>It is an error to place the [unchanging] annotation on any of these types:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>a struct type with member types that are not universally non- resilient</li>
<li>an enum type with an enumerator whose type is not universally non- resilient</li>
<li>a class extension</li>
<li>a class whose primary definition contains a field which is not universally
non-resilient</li>

<h2>Classes<a class="headerlink" href="#classes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>It is an error to place the [unchanging] annotation on a class extension.</p>
<p>It is an error to place the [unchanging] annotation on a class whose primary
definition contains a field whose type is potentially resilient in a context
where the class is accessible. That is, if the class is exported, all of its
fields must be universally non- resilient. If it is not exported, all of its
fields must be non- resilient within its resilience unit.</p>
<p>It is allowed to add fields to an [unchanging] class in a class extension. Such
fields are always side-stored, even if they are declared within the same
resilience unit.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="objects">
<h2>Objects<a class="headerlink" href="#objects" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Right now, all types in Swift are &#8220;first-class&#8221;, meaning that there is a broad
range of generic operations can be</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>the size and layout of first-class objects:<ul>
<li>local variables</li>
<li>global variables</li>
<li>dynamically*allocated objects</li>
<li>member sub*objects of a structure</li>
<li>base sub*objects of a class</li>
<li>element sub*objects of an array</li>
<li>parameters of functions</li>
<li>results of functions</li>

<p>ABI resilience means not making assumptions about language entities which limit
the ability of the maintainers of those entities to change them later. Language
entities are functions and objects. ABI resilience is a high priority of Swift.</p>

<h2>Notes from meeting.<a class="headerlink" href="#notes-from-meeting" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We definitely want to support resilient value types. Use cases: strings, dates,
opaque numbers, etc. Want to lock down API even without a concrete
implementation yet.</p>
<p>This implies that we have to support runtime data layout. Need examples of that.</p>
<p>We do need to be resilient against adding [unchanging]. Okay to have two levels
of this: [born_unchanging] for things that are universally non-resilient,
[unchanging] for things that were once resilient.  Proposed names:
[born_fragile] and [fragile].</p>
<p>Global functions always export a maximally-resilient entrypoint. If there exist
any [fragile] arguments, and there do not exist any resilient arguments, they
also export a [fragile] copy. Callers do… something? Have to know what they&#8217;re
deploying against, I guess.</p>

<p>What does fragility mean for different kinds of objects?</p>
<p>structs (value types) - layout is fixed</p>
<p>their fields - can access field directly rather than by getter/setter</p>
<p>their methods - like any function</p>
<p>classes (reference types) - layout of this struct component is fixed</p>
<p>their fields - access directly vs. getter/setter</p>
<p>their methods - like any function</p>
<p>class extensions - like classes. what to do about layout of multiple class
extensions? very marginal</p>
<p>functions - inlinable</p>
<p>global variables - can be directly accessed. Type is born_fragile: value is
global address. Type is resilient: lvalue is load of global pointer. Type is
fragile: value is load of global pointer, also optional global address using
same mechanism as global functions with fragile argument types</p>
<p>protocols - born_fragile =&gt; laid out as vtable. Can these be resilient?</p>
<p>their implementations: contents of vtable are knowable</p>
<p>enums - layout, set of variants</p>

<p>Resilience attributes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>born_fragile, fragile, resilient</li>
<li>want to call born_fragile =&gt; fragile, fragile =&gt; fragile(macosx10.42)</li>
<li>good except &#8220;default&#8221;, more minimal thing is the more aggressive thing. More
important to have an ABI-checking tool</li>
<li>use availability attributes scheme: platformX.Y.Z</li>
</ul>
<p>Components: Very much a build-system thing.</p>
<p>Users should be able to write swift [foo.swift]+ and have it build an
executable.</p>
<p>For anything more complicated, need a component description file.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>hierarchy of components</li>
<li>type of build product: executable, dylib, even object file</li>
<li>non-Swift sources (object files, C files, whatever)</li>
<li>deployment options (deploying on macosxX.Y.Z)</li>
<li>need some sort of &#8220;include this subcomponent&#8221; declaration</li>
<li>probably want some level of metaprogramming, maybe the preprocessor?</li>
</ul>
<p>Host of ways of find the component description file automatically: name a
directory (and find with fixed name), name nothing (and find in current
directory)</p>
<p>Component organization is the seat of the decision algorithm for whether we can
access something resilient fragilely or not.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>not necessarily just &#8220;are you in my component&#8221;; maybe &#8220;are you in my
domain/component tree/whatever&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>Resilience is lexically inherited.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Declarations inside a fragile enum are implicitly fragile, etc.</li>
<li>Except anything inside a function is fragile.</li>
</ul>
<p>Break it down by types of declarations.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>typealias has no resilience</li>
<li>struct — the set/order of fields can change — means size/alignment, layout,
copy/destruction semantics, etc. can all change</li>
<li>fields - direct access vs. getter/setter</li>
<li>funcs - as if top level</li>
<li>types - as if top level</li>
<li>class — same as a structs, plus</li>
<li>base classes — can&#8217;t completely remove a base class (breaks interface), but
can introduce a new intermediate base</li>
<li>virtual dispatch — table vs. dictionary, devirtualization (to which
decl?). Some amount of table lookup can be done as static vs. dynamic offsets</li>
<li>funcs — inlineability</li>
<li>vars — direct access vs. getter/setter. Direct accesses for types that aren&#8217;t
inherently fragile need to be indirected because they may need to be
dynamically allocated. In general, might be actor-local, this is for when the
model does say &#8220;global variable&#8221;.</li>
<li>extensions of classes — like class. Fields are always side-allocated if we&#8217;re
extending a class not defined in this component (w/i domain?). Making a class
fragile is also a promise not to add more fields in extensions in this
component; probably need a way to force a side-table.</li>
<li>protocols — can&#8217;t remove/change existing methods, but can add defaulted
methods. Doing this resiliently requires load-time checking.  vtable for
non-defaulted methods, ? for rest?</li>
<li>enum - set of directly represented cases</li>
<li>enum elements - directly represented vs. injection/projection.</li>
<li>enum - called out so that we can have an extensible thing that promises no
data fields. Always an i32 when resilient.</li>
<li>const - fragile by default, as if a var otherwise</li>
